# Web cache poisoning

Web cache poisoning involves putting a payload into the cache of a user. For example, when a user's browser then retrieves a URL from the cache, the URL is poisoned and so will execute a payload.

In order to exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must find the name of (lets say a js file) that the web app imports.
